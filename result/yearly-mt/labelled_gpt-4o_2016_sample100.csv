W16-2342,{C}harac{T}er: Translation Edit Rate on Character Level,"Recently, the capability of character-level evaluation measures for machine translation output has been confirmed by several metrics. This work proposes translation edit rate on character level (CharacTER), which calculates the character level edit distance while performing the shift edit on word level. The novel metric shows high system-level correlation with human rankings, especially for morphologically rich languages. It outperforms the strong CHRF by up to 7% correlation on different metric tasks. In addition, we apply the hypothesis sentence length for normalizing the edit distance in CharacTER, which also provides significant improvements compared to using the reference sentence length.",2016,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"B, D",240,3,243
W16-3803,Microsyntactic Phenomena as a Computational Linguistics Issue,"Microsyntactic linguistic units, such as syntactic idioms and non-standard syntactic constructions, are poorly represented in linguistic resources, mostly because the former are elements occupying an intermediate position between the lexicon and the grammar and the latter are too specific to be routinely tackled by general grammars. Consequently, many such units produce substantial gaps in systems intended to solve sophisticated computational linguistics tasks, such as parsing, deep semantic analysis, question answering, machine translation, or text generation. They also present obstacles for applying advanced techniques to these tasks, such as machine learning. The paper discusses an approach aimed at bridging such gaps, focusing on the development of monolingual and multilingual corpora where microsyntactic units are to be tagged. Rakhilina 2010) two main groups of linguistic units are distinguished: lexically oriented syntactic idioms and lexically independent non-standard syntactic constructions. Throughout the paper, I will be mostly concerned with syntactic idioms, which means that the concepts ""microsyntactic units"" and ""syntactic idioms"" are basically synonymous.",2016,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,"A, E",336,3,339

In particular, we adopt a pairwise neural network (NN) architecture, which incorporates MTE features, as well as rich syntactic and semantic embeddings, and which efficiently models complex non-linear interactions. The evaluation results show state-of-the-art performance, with sizeable contribution from both the MTE features and from the pairwise NN architecture.",2016,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,"D, G",212,3,215
W16-2389,Translation Quality Estimation using Recurrent Neural Network,"This paper describes our submission to the shared task on word/phrase level Quality Estimation (QE) in the First Conference on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT16). The objective of the shared task was to predict if the given word/phrase is a correct/incorrect (OK/BAD) translation in the given sentence. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for word level Quality Estimation using Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNN-LM) architecture. RNN-LMs have been found very effective in different Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. RNN-LM is mainly used for vector space language modeling for different NLP problems. For this task, we modify the architecture of RNN-LM. The modified system predicts a label (OK/BAD) in the slot rather than predicting the word. The input to the system is a word sequence, similar to the standard RNN-LM. The approach is language independent and requires only the translated text for QE. To estimate the phrase level quality, we use the output of the word level QE system.",2016,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"B, D",334,3,337
L16-1044,Building a Corpus of Errors and Quality in Machine Translation: Experiments on Error Impact,"In this paper we describe a corpus of automatic translations annotated with both error type and quality. The 300 sentences that we have selected were generated by Google Translate, Systran and two in-house Machine Translation systems that use Moses technology. The errors present on the translations were annotated with an error taxonomy that divides errors in five main linguistic categories (Orthography, Lexis, Grammar, Semantics and Discourse), reflecting the language level where the error is located. After the error annotation process, we accessed the translation quality of each sentence using a four point comprehension scale from 1 to 5. Both tasks of error and quality annotation were performed by two different annotators, achieving good levels of inter-annotator agreement. The creation of this corpus allowed us to use it as training data for a translation quality classifier. We concluded on error severity by observing the outputs of two machine learning classifiers: a decision tree and a regression model.",2016,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,"A, E",304,3,307
W16-3416,A Contextual Language Model to Improve Machine Translation of Pronouns by Re-ranking Translation Hypotheses,"This paper addresses the translation divergencies of pronouns from English to French, specifically it and they, which have several gendered and non-gendered possible translations into French. Instead of using anaphora resolution, which is error-prone, we build a target language model that estimates the probabilities of a tuple of consecutive nouns followed by a pronoun. We bring evidence for the linguistic validity of the model, showing that the probability of observing a pronoun with a given gender and number increases with the proportion of nouns with the same gender and number preceding it. We use this French language model to re-rank the translation hypotheses generated by a phrase-based statistical machine translation system. While none of the pronoun-focused translation systems at the DiscoMT 2015 shared task improved over the baseline, our proposal achieves a modest but statistically significant improvement over it.",2016,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,"D, F",288,3,291
J16-1004,Online Learning for Statistical Machine Translation,"We present online learning techniques for statistical machine translation (SMT). The availability of large training data sets that grow constantly over time is becoming more and more frequent in the field of SMT-for example, in the context of translation agencies or the daily translation of government proceedings. When new knowledge is to be incorporated in the SMT models, the use of batch learning techniques require very time-consuming estimation processes over the whole training set that may take days or weeks to be executed. By means of the application of online learning, new training samples can be processed individually in real time. For this purpose, we define a state-of-the-art SMT model composed of a set of submodels, as well as a set of incremental update rules for each of these submodels. To test our techniques, we have studied two well-known SMT applications that can be used in translation agencies: post-editing and interactive machine translation. In both scenarios, the SMT system collaborates with the user to generate highquality translations. These user-validated translations can be used to extend the SMT models by means of online learning. Empirical results in the two scenarios under consideration show the great impact of frequent updates in the system performance. The time cost of such updates was also measured, comparing the efficiency of a batch learning SMT system with that of an online learning system, showing that online learning is able to work in real time whereas the time cost of batch retraining soon becomes infeasible. Empirical results also showed that the performance of online learning is comparable to that of batch learning. Moreover, the proposed techniques were able to learn from previously estimated models or from scratch. We also propose two new measures to predict the effectiveness of online learning in SMT tasks. The translation system with online learning capabilities presented here is implemented in the open-source Thot toolkit for SMT.",2016,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"B, D",479,3,482

This paper explores whether knowledge about semantic affinities between the target predicates and their argument fillers is useful for translating ambiguous predicates and arguments. We propose a selectional preference feature based on the selectional association measure of Resnik (1996) and integrate it in a string-to-tree decoder. The feature models selectional preferences of verbs for their core and prepositional arguments as well as selectional preferences of nouns for their prepositional arguments. We compare our features with a variant of the neural relational dependency language model (RDLM) (Sennrich, 2015) and find that neither of the features improves automatic evaluation metrics. We conclude that mistranslated verbs, errors in the target syntactic trees produced by the decoder and underspecified syntactic relations are negatively impacting these features.",2016,False,False,False,True,False,True,False,"D, F",294,3,297

We show that ClusterCat is 3-85 times faster than four other well-known clusterers, while also improving upon the predictive exchange algorithm's perplexity by up to 18% .

We propose to use the binary aligned tree structures delivered by this method as training data for preordering prior to machine translation. For that, we learn a Bracketing Transduction Grammar (BTG) from these binary aligned tree structures. In two oracle experiments in English to Japanese and Japanese to English translation, we show that it is theoretically possible to outperform a baseline system with a default distortion limit of 6, by about 2.5 and 5 BLEU points and, 7 and 10 RIBES points respectively, when preordering the source sentences using the learnt preordering model and using a distortion limit of 0.

2016.amta-researchers.3,Fuzzy-match repair using black-box machine translation systems: what can be expected?,"Computer-aided translation (CAT) tools often use a translation memory (TM) as the key resource to assist translators. A TM contains translation units (TU) which are made up of source and target language segments; translators use the target segments in the TU suggested by the CAT tool by converting them into the desired translation. Proposals from TMs could be made more useful by using techniques such as fuzzy-match repair (FMR) which modify words in the target segment corresponding to mismatches identified in the source segment. Modifications in the target segment are done by translating the mismatched source sub-segments using an external source of bilingual information (SBI) and applying the translations to the corresponding positions in the target segment. Several combinations of translated sub-segments can be applied to the target segment which can produce multiple repair candidates. We provide a formal algorithmic description of a method that is capable of using any SBI to generate all possible fuzzy-match repairs and perform an oracle evaluation on three different language pairs to ascertain the potential of the method to improve translation productivity. Using DGT-TM translation memories and the machine system Apertium as the single source to build repair operators in three different language pairs, we show that the best repaired fuzzy matches are consistently closer to reference translations than either machine-translated segments or unrepaired fuzzy matches.",2016,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,"B, C",383,3,386

Our approach does not depend on the availability of large amounts of in-domain parallel data, but only relies on available large datasets of monolingually captioned images, and on state-ofthe-art convolutional neural networks to compute image similarities.

On most translation systems the same word embedding is fed to both BiRNN units. In this paper, we present several experiments to enhance a baseline sequence-to-sequence system (Elliott et al., 2015) , for example, by using double embeddings. These embeddings are trained on the forward and backward direction of the input sequence. Our system is trained, validated and tested on the Multi30K dataset (Elliott et al., 2016) in the context of the WMT 2016 Multimodal Translation Task.

As we do not expect the user to tolerate more than a few proposals each time, the set of potential suggestions need to be filtered and ranked; the resource-agnostic approach has been evaluated before using a set of intuitive length-based and position-based heuristics designed to determine which suggestions to show, achieving promising results.

For dealing with all types of errors, grammatical error correction methods that employ statistical machine translation (SMT) have been proposed in recent years. An SMT system generates candidates with scores for all candidates and selects the sentence with the highest score as the correction result. However, the 1-best result of an SMT system is not always the best result. Thus, we propose a reranking approach for grammatical error correction. The reranking approach is used to re-score N-best results of the SMT and reorder the results.

In this paper, we adopt a supersense tagging method to annotate source words with coarse-grained ontological concepts. In order to enable the system to choose an appropriate translation for a word or phrase according to the annotated supersense of the word or phrase, we propose two translation models with supersense knowledge: a maximum entropy based model and a supersense embedding model.

We build hybrid systems that translate mostly at the word level and consult the character components for rare words. Our character-level recurrent neural networks compute source word representations and recover unknown target words when needed. The twofold advantage of such a hybrid approach is that it is much faster and easier to train than character-based ones; at the same time, it never produces unknown words as in the case of word-based models. On the WMT'15 English to Czech translation task, this hybrid approach offers an addition boost of +2.1−11.4 BLEU points over models that already handle unknown words. Our best system achieves a new state-of-the-art result with 20.7 BLEU score.

Human-targeted translation edit rate (HTER) is by far the most widely employed human-targeted metric in machine translation, commonly employed, for example, as a gold standard in evaluation of quality estimation. Original experiments justifying the design of HTER, as opposed to other possible formulations, were limited to a small sample of translations and a single language pair, however, and this motivates our re-evaluation of a range of human-targeted metrics on a substantially larger scale. Results show significantly stronger correlation with human judgment for HBLEU over HTER for two of the nine language pairs we include and no significant difference between correlations achieved by HTER and HBLEU for the remaining language pairs. Finally, we evaluate a range of quality estimation systems employing HTER and direct assessment (DA) of translation adequacy as gold labels, resulting in a divergence in system rankings, and propose employment of DA for future quality estimation evaluations.",2016,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,"E, F",349,3,352

We also show that the Bi-SSCNN method is much more effective than other methods in preventing noisy sentence pairs from being chosen for training. More interestingly, this method only needs a tiny amount of in-domain data to train the selection model, which makes fine-grained topic-dependent translation adaptation possible. In the follow-up experiments, we find that neural machine translation (NMT) is more sensitive to noisy data than statistical machine translation (SMT). Therefore, Bi-SSCNN which can effectively screen out noisy sentence pairs, can benefit NMT much more than SMT.We observed a BLEU improvement over 3 points on an English-to-French WMT task when Bi-SSCNNs were used.",2016,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"B, D",377,3,380

We will describe our experience with some of the features that are available in some implementations, but this paper will concentrate on suggesting ""Recommended Specifications"" for such tools, by resorting to the capacities of Machine Learning methods, complemented by Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Intelligence, to deal with huge volumes of data. Our starting point is the tasks that translators perform in an interconnected world -clients, and human and machine resources. We will then present some of the Machine Learning features that may be used as supports to the work of translators and post-editors.

Nevertheless a drawback of using bilingual dictionaries trained by IBM Models in length-and-word-based methods is the problem of out-of-vocabulary (OOV). We propose using word similarity learned from monolingual corpora to overcome the problem.

We demonstrate the efficacy of weight pruning as a compression technique for a state-of-the-art NMT system.

However, depending on the practical requirements, evaluation approaches can differ strongly. Often, reference-based evaluation measures (such as BLEU or WER) are appealing because they are cheap and allow rapid quantitative comparison. On the other hand, practitioners often focus on manual evaluation because they must deal with frequently changing domains and quality standards requested by customers, for which reference-based evaluation is insufficient or not possible due to missing in-domain reference data (Harris et al., 2016) . In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by proposing a framework for lightly supervised quality estimation. We collect manually annotated scores for a small number of segments in a test corpus or document, and combine them with automatically predicted quality scores for the remaining segments to predict an overall quality estimate. An evaluation shows that our framework estimates quality more reliably than using fully automatic quality estimation approaches, while keeping annotation effort low by not requiring full references to be available for the particular domain.",2016,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,"D, G",337,3,340

In comparison, phrase is a smaller and more fine grained unit for data selection, therefore we propose a straightforward and efficient connecting phrase based adaptation method, which is applied to both bilingual phrase pair and monolingual n-gram adaptation.

These two data sets are then used to perform an analysis of errors in dependency parsing, word-level alignment and MT, which arise from the discontinuous order in V-Prt split constructions. In the automatic alignments of parallel corpora, most of the particles align to NULL. These mis-alignments and the inability of phrase-based MT system to recover discontinuous phrases result in low quality translations of V-Prt split constructions both in English and German.

In the Chimera combination, TectoMT is complemented by a Moses PB-SMT system (factored setup with additional language models over morphological tags) and optionally also by an automatic postprocessing (correction) component called Depfix. Chimera can be thus characterized as a hybrid system that combines statistical MT with deep linguistic analysis and automatic post-correction system, which is useful especially for translation into inflectionally rich languages. The three systems are combined serially: TectoMT runs first, then an additional Moses phrase table is extracted from TectoMT's input and output. The additional table is then used in a weighted combination with a large Moses translation table to produce pre-final output. Depfix then re-parses the output (as well as input) and generates the final output based on rules reflecting morphosyntactic properties of the target language.

However, each language expresses action verbs in its own inherently unique manner by categorization. One verb can refer to several interpretations of actions and one action can be expressed by more than one verb. The inter-language and intra-language variations create ambiguity for the translation of languages from the source language to target language with respect to action verbs.

C16-1243,Enriching Phrase Tables for Statistical Machine Translation Using Mixed Embeddings,"The phrase table is considered to be the main bilingual resource for the phrase-based statistical machine translation (PBSMT) model. During translation, a source sentence is decomposed into several phrases. The best match of each source phrase is selected among several target-side counterparts within the phrase table, and processed by the decoder to generate a sentence-level translation. The best match is chosen according to several factors, including a set of bilingual features. PBSMT engines by default provide four probability scores in phrase tables which are considered as the main set of bilingual features. Our goal is to enrich that set of features, as a better feature set should yield better translations. We propose new scores generated by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which indicate the semantic relatedness of phrase pairs. We evaluate our model in different experimental settings with different language pairs. We observe significant improvements when the proposed features are incorporated into the PBSMT pipeline.",2016,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"B, D",300,3,303
2016.amta-users.7,Machine Translation Acceptance Among Professional Linguists: Are We Nearing the Tipping Point?,"This paper evaluates the level of acceptance of Machine Translation (MT) among translators as of Summer, 2016. Translators are notoriously shy about MT, and their level of acceptance has a lot to say about the level reached by MT. Credits This text format is derived from the AMTA guidelines for documents submitted for inclusion in AMTA proceedings. MT Among Translators: the Early Days Translators have been aware of Machine Translation (MT) ever since it first began: the era of automated weather bulletin translation by robots after World War II. But they remained outsiders for a few decades. The Nineties can be seen as the first foray of MT in the world of translators, when the first off-the-shelf solutions (Systran, PowerTranslator, ProMT, etc.) appeared at affordable prices. Still, computer savviness was a prerequisite, which greatly limited the spread of MT use among translators. The Real Start The nineties witnessed a few earth-shaking changes that redesigned the life of translators for ever, like the widespread acceptance and use of wordprocessors. The spread of the internet is another key factor. While the Internet (and online sales) are credited for the downfall of middlemen like travel agencies, the same factor can be credited for the opposite in translation: the sharp increase in the number of translation agencies. With the ability to team up hundreds of translators and quickly form ad hoc translation task forces for large translation projects, the translation agency, as we know it today, was born. One collateral effect of agencies attracting the bulk of translation orders was the relentless push toward lower costs. Human translation was considered a relative luxury before the nineties. With the age of luxury for the masses (from smoked salmon to ocean cruises to oversea vacations) came translation for the masses, at least in the business world. Businesses and companies, however small they are, can today call an agency and get 100 pages translated into 20 languages in a week: that was a surhuman feat in the past, available only to very large organizations.",2016,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,"E, G",532,3,535

However, building the monolingual parallel corpus necessary for training the model requires costly human annotation. Monolingual parallel corpora for text simplification have therefore been built only for a limited number of languages, such as English and Portuguese. To obviate the need for human annotation, we propose an unsupervised method that automatically builds the monolingual parallel corpus for text simplification using sentence similarity based on word embeddings. For any sentence pair comprising a complex sentence and its simple counterpart, we employ a many-to-one method of aligning each word in the complex sentence with the most similar word in the simple sentence and compute sentence similarity by averaging these word similarities. The experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method in a monolingual parallel corpus construction task for English text simplification. The results also demonstrated the superior accuracy in text simplification that use the framework of statistical machine translation trained using the corpus built by the proposed method to that using the existing corpora.",2016,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,"A, D",332,3,335

C16-1011,A Correlational Encoder Decoder Architecture for Pivot Based Sequence Generation,"Interlingua based Machine Translation (MT) aims to encode multiple languages into a common linguistic representation and then decode sentences in multiple target languages from this representation. In this work we explore this idea in the context of neural encoder decoder architectures, albeit on a smaller scale and without MT as the end goal. Specifically, we consider the case of three languages or modalities X, Z and Y wherein we are interested in generating sequences in Y starting from information available in X. However, there is no parallel training data available between X and Y but, training data is available between X & Z and Z & Y (as is often the case in many real world applications). Z thus acts as a pivot/bridge. An obvious solution, which is perhaps less elegant but works very well in practice is to train a two stage model which first converts from X to Z and then from Z to Y . Instead we explore an interlingua inspired solution which jointly learns to do the following (i) encode X and Z to a common representation and (ii) decode Y from this common representation. We evaluate our model on two tasks: (i) bridge transliteration and (ii) bridge captioning. We report promising results in both these applications and believe that this is a right step towards truly interlingua inspired encoder decoder architectures.",2016,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"B, D",380,3,383

Then, for each identified span, we generate a pool of possible compounds which are added to the translation model as ""synthetic"" phrase translations. Experiments reveal that (i) we can effectively predict what spans can be compounded; (ii) our compound generation model produces good compounds; and (iii) modest improvements are possible in end-to-end English-German and English-Finnish translation tasks.

In NMTs, words that are out of vocabulary are represented by a single unknown token. In this paper, we propose a method that enables NMT to translate patent sentences comprising a large vocabulary of technical terms. We train an NMT system on bilingual data wherein technical terms are replaced with technical term tokens; this allows it to translate most of the source sentences except technical terms. Further, we use it as a decoder to translate source sentences with technical term tokens and replace the tokens with technical term translations using SMT. We also use it to rerank the 1,000-best SMT translations on the basis of the average of the SMT score and that of the NMT rescoring of the translated sentences with technical term tokens.

According to the shared task results, our primary and contrastive (which does not include the QE module) submissions have similar performance and achieved significant improvement of 3.31% TER and 4.25% BLEU (relative) over the baseline MT system on the English-German evaluation set.",2016,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"B, D",317,3,320
