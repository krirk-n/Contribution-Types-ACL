P15-1095,Robust Subgraph Generation Improves {A}bstract {M}eaning {R}epresentation Parsing,"The Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) is a representation for opendomain rich semantics, with potential use in fields like event extraction and machine translation. Node generation, typically done using a simple dictionary lookup, is currently an important limiting factor in AMR parsing. We propose a small set of actions that derive AMR subgraphs by transformations on spans of text, which allows for more robust learning of this stage. Our set of construction actions generalize better than the previous approach, and can be learned with a simple classifier. We improve on the previous state-of-the-art result for AMR parsing, boosting end-to-end performance by 3 F 1 on both the LDC2013E117 and LDC2014T12 datasets.",2015,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"B, D",266,3,269

In this paper, we provide solutions to each of these challenges and outline a new human evaluation methodology aimed specifically at assessment of segment-level metrics. We replicate the human evaluation component of WMT-13 and reveal that the current state-of-the-art performance of segment-level metrics is better than previously believed. Three segment-level metrics -METEOR, NLEPOR and SENTBLEU-MOSES -are found to correlate with human assessment at a level not significantly outperformed by any other metric in both the individual language pair assessment for Spanish-to-English and the aggregated set of 9 language pairs.",2015,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,"E, F",294,3,297

We present methods of non-compositionality detection for English noun compounds using the unsupervised learning of a semantic composition function. Compounds which are not well modeled by the learned semantic composition function are considered noncompositional. We explore a range of distributional vector-space models for semantic composition, empirically evaluate these models, and propose additional methods which improve results further. We show that a complex function such as polynomial projection can learn semantic composition and identify non-compositionality in an unsupervised way, beating all other baselines ranging from simple to complex. We show that enforcing sparsity is a useful regularizer in learning complex composition functions. We show further improvements by training a decomposition function in addition to the composition function.

W15-5708,First Steps in Using Word Senses as Contextual Features in Maxent Models for Machine Translation,"Despite the common assumption that word sense disambiguation (WSD) should help to improve lexical choice and improve the quality of the output of machine translation systems, how to successfully integrate word senses into such systems remains an unanswered question. While significant improvements have been reported using reformulated approaches to the disambiguation task itself -most notably in predicting translations of full phrases as opposed to the senses of single words -little improvement or encouragement has been gleaned from the incorporation of traditional WSD into machine translation. In this paper, we present preliminary results that suggest that incorporating output from WSD as contextual features in a maxent-based translation model yields a slight improvement in the quality of machine translation and is potentially a step in the right direction, in contrast to other approaches to introducing word senses into a machine translation system which significantly impede its performance.",2015,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,catching classes that do not inherit from BaseException is not allowed,0,0,0

Despite its recent success, neural machine translation has its limitation in handling a larger vocabulary, as training complexity as well as decoding complexity increase proportionally to the number of target words. In this paper, we propose a method based on importance sampling that allows us to use a very large target vocabulary without increasing training complexity. We show that decoding can be efficiently done even with the model having a very large target vocabulary by selecting only a small subset of the whole target vocabulary. The models trained by the proposed approach are empirically found to match, and in some cases outperform, the baseline models with a small vocabulary as well as the LSTM-based neural machine translation models.

Syntactic language models have the potential to fill this modelling gap. We propose a language model for dependency structures that is relational rather than configurational and thus particularly suited for languages with a (relatively) free word order. It is trainable with Neural Networks, and not only improves over standard n-gram language models, but also outperforms related syntactic language models. We empirically demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of perplexity and as a feature function in string-to-tree SMT from English to German and Russian. We also show that using a syntactic evaluation metric to tune the log-linear parameters of an SMT system further increases translation quality when coupled with a syntactic language model.",2015,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"B, D",308,3,311

Previous studies separately exploit sentence-level contexts and documentlevel topics for lexical selection, neglecting their correlations. In this paper, we propose a context-aware topic model for lexical selection, which not only models local contexts and global topics but also captures their correlations. The model uses target-side translations as hidden variables to connect document topics and source-side local contextual words. In order to learn hidden variables and distributions from data, we introduce a Gibbs sampling algorithm for statistical estimation and inference. A new translation probability based on distributions learned by the model is integrated into a translation system for lexical selection.

An essay by the American writer Richard Powers, currently not available in French, is automatically translated and post-edited and then revised by non-professional translators. In addition to presenting experimental evaluation results of the MT+PE pipeline (MT system used, automatic evaluation), we also discuss the quality of the translation output from the perspective of a panel of readers (who read the translated short story in French, and answered a survey afterwards).

We perform search by using an SMT decoder in forced decoding mode to produce a bag-ofwords representation of the target documents to be ranked.

We use the oracle reorderings to empirically quantify an upper bound on improvement in translation quality through post-ordering techniques.

We address this problem by modeling sequences of fine-grained morphological tags in a bilingual context. To overcome the issue of ambiguous word analyses, we introduce soft tags, which are under-specified representations retaining all possible morphological attributes of a word. In order to learn distributed representations for the soft tags and their interactions we adopt a neural network approach.

J15-4001,Graph-Based Word Alignment for Clinical Language Evaluation,"Among the more recent applications for natural language processing algorithms has been the analysis of spoken language data for diagnostic and remedial purposes, fueled by the demand for simple, objective, and unobtrusive screening tools for neurological disorders such as dementia. The automated analysis of narrative retellings in particular shows potential as a component of such a screening tool since the ability to produce accurate and meaningful narratives is noticeably impaired in individuals with dementia and its frequent precursor, mild cognitive impairment, as well as other neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders. In this article, we present a method for extracting narrative recall scores automatically and highly accurately from a word-level alignment between a retelling and the source narrative. We propose improvements to existing machine translation-based systems for word alignment, including a novel method of word alignment relying on random walks on a graph that achieves alignment accuracy superior to that of standard expectation maximization-based techniques for word alignment in a fraction of the time required for expectation maximization. In addition, the narrative recall score features extracted from these high-quality word alignments yield diagnostic classification accuracy comparable to that achieved using manually assigned scores and significantly higher than that achieved with summary-level text similarity metrics used in other areas of NLP. These methods can be trivially adapted to spontaneous language samples elicited with non-linguistic stimuli, thereby demonstrating the flexibility and generalizability of these methods.",2015,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,"C, G",389,3,392

Previous studies show that semantic parsing with synchronous contextfree grammars (SCFGs) achieves favorable performance over most other alternatives. Motivated by the observation that the performance of semantic parsing with SCFGs is closely tied to the translation rules, this paper explores extending translation rules with high quality and increased coverage in three ways. First, we introduce structure informed non-terminals, better guiding the parsing in favor of well formed structure, instead of using a uninformed non-terminal in SCFGs. Second, we examine the difference between word alignments for semantic parsing and statistical machine translation (SMT) to better adapt word alignment in SMT to semantic parsing. Finally, we address the unknown word translation issue via synthetic translation rules.

A tree-modified Viterbi algorithm is then utilized to find the most probable hidden tree containing the correct lemmas given their context. The model is implemented in a Machine Translation system for English to Dutch. The output sentences, generated from the modified dependency structures, contained a lot of erroneous substituted words. This is mainly due to the fact that a large amount of synsets, used as input for the model, are incorrect. The input to the model now contains the synset that is most frequent given the lemma in general, not the optimal synset given the domain of the sentences.

In terms of translation effort, we found that the use of options can require less technical effort than MT post-editing for a domain that yields lowerquality MT output.

To resolve the problems, we propose a hierarchical back-off model for Hiero grammar, an instance of a synchronous context free grammar (SCFG), on the basis of the hierarchical Pitman-Yor process. The model can extract a compact rule and phrase table without resorting to any heuristics by hierarchically backing off to smaller phrases under SCFG. Inference is efficiently carried out using two-step synchronous parsing of Xiao et al., (2012) combined with slice sampling. In our experiments, the proposed model achieved higher or at least comparable translation quality against a previous Bayesian model on various language pairs; German/French/Spanish/Japanese-English.

However, in order for a machine to understand and make inferences on these health conditions, the ability to recognise when laymen's terms refer to a particular medical concept (i.e. text normalisation) is required. To achieve this, we propose to adapt an existing phrase-based machine translation (MT) technique and a vector representation of words to map between a social media phrase and a medical concept.

Dong et al. (2015) proposed a method of generating bilingual technical term lexicon from morpheme-segmented parallel patent sentences. The proposed method estimates Japanese-Chinese translation of technical terms using the phrase translation table of a statistical machine translation model. The procedure of generating bilingual technical term lexicon consists of the following four steps: (1) extracting Japanese technical terms from Japanese side of parallel patent sentences, (2) collecting all the sentences that contain the extracted Japanese term, (3) generating Chinese translation of the Japanese technical term referring to the phrase translation table of a statistical machine translation model, and (4) applying the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to the task of identifying bilingual technical terms. In this paper, we segment the Chinese sentences into characters instead of segmenting them into morphemes as in Dong et al.

We present an application to discriminative reranking in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) where the learning algorithm only has access to a 1 − BLEU loss evaluation of a predicted translation instead of obtaining a gold standard reference translation. In our experiment bandit feedback is obtained by evaluating BLEU on reference translations without revealing them to the algorithm. This can be thought of as a simulation of interactive machine translation where an SMT system is personalized by a user who provides single point feedback to predicted translations. Our experiments show that our approach improves translation quality and is comparable to approaches that employ more informative feedback in learning. 1 The name is inherited from a model where in each round a gambler pulls an arm of a different slot machine (""one-armed bandit""), with the goal of maximizing his reward relative to the maximal possible reward, without apriori knowledge of the optimal slot machine.",2015,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,"C, G",336,3,339

As a proof of concept we first show improved translation performance for a phrase-based model translating source strings enriched with morphological features projected through the word alignments from target words to source words. Given this potential, we present a model for predicting target morphological features on the source string and its predicate-argument structure, and tackle two major technical challenges: (1) How to fit the morphological feature set to training data? and (2) How to integrate the morphology into the back-end phrase-based model such that it can also be trained on projected (rather than predicted) features for a more efficient pipeline? For the first challenge we present a latent variable model, and show that it learns a feature set with quality comparable to a manually selected set for German.

In this paper, we demonstrate that deep NLMs with three or four layers outperform those with fewer layers in terms of both the perplexity and the translation quality. We combine various techniques to successfully train deep NLMs that jointly condition on both the source and target contexts.

W15-3058,Dependency Analysis of Scrambled References for Better Evaluation of {J}apanese Translation,"In English-to-Japanese translation, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), the de facto standard evaluation metric for machine translation (MT), has very weak correlation with human judgments (Goto et al., 2011; Goto et al., 2013) . Therefore, RIBES (Isozaki et al., 2010; Hirao et  al., 2014)  was proposed. RIBES measures similarity of the word order of a machine-translated sentence and that of a corresponding human-translated reference sentence. RIBES has much stronger correlation than BLEU but most Japanese sentences have alternative word orders (scrambling), and one reference sentence is not sufficient for fair evaluation. Isozaki et al. (2014)  proposed a solution to this problem. This solution generates semantically equivalent word orders of reference sentences. Automatically generated word orders are sometimes incomprehensible or misleading, and they introduced a heuristic rule that filters out such bad sentences. However, their rule is too conservative and generated alternative word orders for only 30% of reference sentences. In this paper, we present a rule-free method that uses a dependency parser to check scrambled sentences and generated alternatives for 80% of sentences. The experimental results show that our method improves sentence-level correlation with human judgments. In addition, strong system-level correlation of single reference RIBES is not damaged very much.

To map probability to acceptability, we experimented with several normalisation functions to neutralise the effects of sentence length and word frequencies.

Based on the manual annotation and alignment of 7266 pairs of discourse relations in a Chinese-English translation corpus, we evaluate whether a preprocessing step that inserts explicit DCs at positions of implicit relations can improve MT. Results show that, without modifying the translation model, explicitating implicit relations in the input source text has limited effect on MT evaluation scores. In addition, translation spotting analysis shows that it is crucial to identify DCs that should be explicitly translated in order to improve implicit-to-explicit DC translation. On the other hand, further analysis reveals that the disambiguation as well as explicitation of implicit relations are subject to a certain level of optionality, suggesting the limitation to learn and evaluate this linguistic phenomenon using standard parallel corpora.",2015,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,"E, G",331,3,334
