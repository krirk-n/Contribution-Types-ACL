D14-1122,Dependency Parsing for {W}eibo: An Efficient Probabilistic Logic Programming Approach,"Dependency parsing is a core task in NLP, and it is widely used by many applications such as information extraction, question answering, and machine translation. In the era of social media, a big challenge is that parsers trained on traditional newswire corpora typically suffer from the domain mismatch issue, and thus perform poorly on social media data. We present a new GFL/FUDG-annotated Chinese treebank with more than 18K tokens from Sina Weibo (the Chinese equivalent of Twitter). We formulate the dependency parsing problem as many small and parallelizable arc prediction tasks: for each task, we use a programmable probabilistic firstorder logic to infer the dependency arc of a token in the sentence. In experiments, we show that the proposed model outperforms an off-the-shelf Stanford Chinese parser, as well as a strong MaltParser baseline that is trained on the same in-domain data.",2014,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,"A, B",298,3,301
2014.amta-wptp.4,Perceived vs. measured performance in the post-editing of suggestions from machine translation and translation memories,"This paper investigates the behaviour of ten professional translators when performing translation tasks with and without translation suggestions, and with and without translation metadata. The measured performances are then compared with the translators' perceptions of their performances. The variables that are taken into consideration are time, edits and errors. Keystroke logging and screen recording are used to measure time and edits, an error score system is used to identify errors and post-performance interviews are used to assess participants' perceptions. The study looks at the correlations between the translators' perceptions and their actual performances, and tries to understand the reasons behind any discrepancies. Translators are found to prefer an environment with translation suggestions and translation metadata to an environment without metadata. This preference, however, does not always correlate with an improved performance. Task familiarity seems to be the most prominent factor responsible for the positive perceptions, rather than any intrinsic characteristics in the tasks. A certain prejudice against MT is also present in some of the comments.",2014,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,"E, F",307,3,310

Thanks to input parse forests and a ""no pruning"" strategy during decoding, the obtained translations are competitive. The drawbacks are a restricted coverage of 70% on test data, in part due to exact input parse tree matching, and a relatively high runtime. Advantages include easy redecoding with a different weight vector, since the full translation forests can be stored after the first decoding pass.",2014,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"B, D",233,3,236

D14-1016,Transformation from Discontinuous to Continuous Word Alignment Improves Translation Quality,"We present a novel approach to improve word alignment for statistical machine translation (SMT). Conventional word alignment methods allow discontinuous alignment, meaning that a source (or target) word links to several target (or source) words whose positions are discontinuous. However, we cannot extract phrase pairs from this kind of alignments as they break the alignment consistency constraint. In this paper, we use a weighted vote method to transform discontinuous word alignment to continuous alignment, which enables SMT systems extract more phrase pairs. We carry out experiments on large scale Chineseto-English and German-to-English translation tasks. Experimental results show statistically significant improvements of BLEU score in both cases over the baseline systems. Our method produces a gain of +1.68 BLEU on NIST OpenMT04 for the phrase-based system, and a gain of +1.28 BLEU on NIST OpenMT06 for the hierarchical phrase-based system.",2014,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,"D, G",301,3,304
2014.amta-researchers.9,Document-level re-ranking with soft lexical and semantic features for statistical machine translation,We introduce two document-level features to polish baseline sentence-level translations generated by a state-of-the-art statistical machine translation (SMT) system. One feature uses the word-embedding technique to model the relation between a sentence and its context on the target side; the other feature is a crisp document-level token-type ratio of target-side translations for source-side words to model the lexical consistency in translation. The weights of introduced features are tuned to optimize the sentence-and document-level metrics simultaneously on the basis of Pareto optimality. Experimental results on two different schemes with different corpora illustrate that the proposed approach can efficiently and stably integrate document-level information into a sentence-level SMT system. The best improvements were approximately 0.5 BLEU on test sets with statistical significance.,2014,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,"D, G",270,3,273

A selection of WMT news data and ""customer"" data provided by language service providers (LSPs) in four language pairs was annotated using MQM issue types and examined in terms of the types of errors found in it. Despite criticisms of WMT data by the LSPs, an examination of the resulting errors and patterns for both types of data shows that they are strikingly consistent, with more variation between language pairs and system types than between text types. These results validate the use of WMT data in an analytic approach to assessing quality and show that analytic approaches represent a useful addition to more traditional assessment methodologies such as BLEU or METEOR.",2014,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,"A, E",292,3,295
C14-1193,{RED}: A Reference Dependency Based {MT} Evaluation Metric,"Most of the widely-used automatic evaluation metrics consider only the local fragments of the references and translations, and they ignore the evaluation on the syntax level. Current syntaxbased evaluation metrics try to introduce syntax information but suffer from the poor parsing results of the noisy machine translations. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel dependency-based evaluation metric which only employs the dependency information of the references. We use two kinds of reference dependency structures: headword chain to capture the long distance dependency information, and fixed and floating structures to capture the local continuous ngram. Experiment results show that our metric achieves higher correlations with human judgments than BLEU, TER and HWCM on WMT 2012 and WMT 2013. By introducing extra linguistic resources and tuning parameters, the new metric gets the state-of-the-art performance which is better than METEOR and SEMPOS on system level, and is comparable with METEOR on sentence level on WMT 2012 and WMT 2013.",2014,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"B, D",315,3,318

D14-1020,Testing for Significance of Increased Correlation with Human Judgment,"Automatic metrics are widely used in machine translation as a substitute for human assessment. With the introduction of any new metric comes the question of just how well that metric mimics human assessment of translation quality. This is often measured by correlation with human judgment. Significance tests are generally not used to establish whether improvements over existing methods such as BLEU are statistically significant or have occurred simply by chance, however. In this paper, we introduce a significance test for comparing correlations of two metrics, along with an open-source implementation of the test.

Scenarios such as incremental machine translation may benefit from some degree of hierarchical syntactic analysis without requiring fully connected parses. We introduce hedge parsing as an approach to recovering constituents of length up to some maximum span L. This approach improves efficiency by bounding constituent size, and allows for efficient segmentation strategies prior to parsing. Unlike shallow parsing methods, hedge parsing yields internal hierarchical structure of phrases within its span bound.

The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder-Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.",2014,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,"F, B",269,3,272
W14-6902,Bilingual Sentence Alignment of a Parallel Corpus by Using {E}nglish as a Pivot Language,"Statistically training a machine translation model requires a parallel corpus containing a huge amount of aligned sentence pairs in both languages. However, it is not easy to obtain such a corpus when English is not the source or the target language. The European Parliament parallel corpus contains only English sentence alignments with 20 European languages, missing alignments for other 190 language pairs. A previous method using sentence length information is not enough reliable to produce alignments for training statistical machine translation models. Hybrid methods combining sentence length and bilingual dictionary information may produce better results, but dictionaries may not be affordable. Thus, we introduce a technique which aligns non-English corpora from the European Parliament by using English as a pivot language without a bilingual dictionary.

In traditional machine translation, a translator must ""wait"" for source material to appear before translation begins. We remove this bottleneck by predicting the final verb in advance.

Traditional machine translation (MT) systems treat LCS data as noise, or just as regular sentences. However, if LCS data is processed intelligently, it can provide a useful signal for training word alignment and MT models. Moreover, LCS data is from non-news sources which can enhance the diversity of training data for MT. In this paper, we first extract constraints from this code switching data and then incorporate them into a word alignment model training procedure. We also show that by using the code switching data, we can jointly train a word alignment model and a language model using cotraining.

Although a natural fit for translation modeling, its flexibility has proved challenging for building real-world systems. In this article, we present a tree-to-tree machine translation system inspired by quasi-synchronous grammar. The core of our approach is a new model that combines phrases and dependency syntax, integrating the advantages of phrase-based and syntax-based translation. We report statistically significant improvements over a phrasebased baseline on five of seven test sets across four language pairs.

Resulting improvements support the presumption that ITGs, which constrain the allowable permutations between compositional segments across the reference and MT output, score the phrasal similarity of the semantic role fillers more accurately than the simple word alignment heuristics (bag-of-word alignment or maximum alignment) used in previous version of MEANT.

Analysis in the project has focused on ""almost good"" translations, those segments where MT systems produce results that can be easily fixed, to understand the barriers that impact the best MT systems. It has also worked on the development of quality estimation and linguistic evaluation techniques to assist MT processes to identify those segments that are good enough to use as is, those that can be easily repaired by human post-editors, and those that should be discarded and translated from scratch. Key findings include the identification of linguistic structures in English that are particularly likely to trigger problems for MT systems of different types (e.g., use of -ing verb forms, nongenitive uses of of, and differences across languages in permissible positions within sentences). These findings were only possible by combining the insights of human evaluators and the output of computational tools.

Spanish is one of the well-known 'pro-drop' languages so that especially a subject pronoun is often omitted, if it can be inferred from the linguistic as well as nonlinguistic context. In Spanish to Korean MT the omitted subject doesn't need to be restored in many cases as Korean also allows a zero subject. However, there are some cases where the omitted subject must be identified to ensure a correct translation. To restore the omitted subject, linguistic clues can be employed, as Spanish verbs undergo morphological flections with respect to the gender and number. However, there still remain some ambiguous cases in which there are more than two possible subject candidates for the specific verb endings. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to resolve Spanish zero subject that integrates linguistic knowledge (morphological information) and artificial intelligence knowledge (machine learning approach).

Its underlying idea is to make use of existing tools and annotations in resource-rich languages to create similar tools and resources for resource-poor languages. Typically, this is achieved by either projecting annotations across parallel corpora, or by transferring models from one or more source languages to a target language. In this paper, we explore a third strategy by using machine translation to create synthetic training data from the original sourceside annotations. Specifically, we apply this technique to dependency parsing, using a cross-lingually unified treebank for adequate evaluation. Our approach draws on annotation projection but avoids the use of noisy source-side annotation of an unrelated parallel corpus and instead relies on manual treebank annotation in combination with statistical machine translation, which makes it possible to train fully lexicalized parsers. We show that this approach significantly outperforms delexicalized transfer parsing.",2014,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,"D, G",309,3,312

It means that the included part is quite different from the existing translations and consequently harder to translate even for an SMT system trained on the same translation data. Because we believe on the proximity of sublanguages even though it is still hard to practically define the sublanguage notion, we are proposing on the framework of the MT@EP project at the Directorate General for Translation (DG TRAD) of the European Parliament (EP) to develop SMT systems specific for each EP Parliamentary Committee optimised for restricted sublanguages and constrained by the EP's particular translation requirements. Sublanguage-specific systems provide better results than generic systems for EP domains showing a very significant quality improvement (5-25% of BLEU score), mainly due to the EP context specificity and to the proximity of sublanguages.

This software was originally designed for monolingual post-editors, but should be equally usable by bilingual post-editors. While it may seem counter-intuitive to present monolingual post-editors with the source sentence, we found that the presence of alignment links between source words and target words can in fact aid a monolingual post-editor, especially with regard to correcting word order. For example, in our experiments using this interface (Schwartz et al., 2014) , post-editors encountered some sentences where a word or phrase was enclosed within bracketing punctuation marks (such as quotation marks, commas, or parentheses) in the source sentence, and the machine translation system incorrectly reordered the word or phrase outside the enclosing punctuation; by examining the alignment links the post-editors were able to correct such reordering mistakes.",2014,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"D, E",352,3,355

It then describes the technology accessible to translators and examines the losses and gains of the used tools in computer-assisted translation such as the electronic dictionaries, and specifically Google translate. The paper studies the influence of the online dictionaries on the professional translator with a view to determining the extent translation done using such dictionaries can be accurate. Loss in machine translation is inevitable due to the differences between English and Malay as they are entirely two different languages and not-related language pairs for translation. The online dictionary and translation software cannot replace the human translator and guarantee high-quality translations, despite their efficiency and outlooks. Online dictionaries and other translation means accelerate and facilitate the translation process only by minimizing the expected time for translation. Combination of electronic technologies with comprehensive knowledge of the translator and translation theory may result in a high-quality translation. Translation software and programs nonetheless, will not replace humans even in the future. As mentioned, the main aim of the paper is to investigate the new technologies in machine translation tools to discover the losses and gains in translation of English to Malay by using online dictionaries.

In contrast to other continuous space approach, RBM based models can easily be integrated into the decoder and are able to directly learn a hidden representation of the n-gram. Previous work on RBM-based language models do not use a shared word representation and therefore, they might suffer of a lack of generalization for larger contexts. Moreover, since the training step is very time consuming, they are only used for quite small copora. In this work we add a shared word representation for the RBMbased language model by factorizing the weight matrix. In addition, we propose an efficient and tailored sampling algorithm that allows us to drastically speed up the training process. Experiments are carried out on two German to English translation tasks and the results show that the training time could be reduced by a factor of 10 without any drop in performance. Furthermore, the RBM-based model can also be trained on large size corpora.",2014,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,"B, C",326,3,329

In this work, we concentrate on the task when the TM database and the SMT training set are different and even from different domains. Firstly, we dynamically merge the matched TM phrase-pairs into the SMT phrase table to meet the real application. Secondly, we propose an improved integrated model to distinguish the original and the newly-added phrase-pairs. Thirdly, a simple but effective TM adaptation method is adopted to favor the consistent translations in cross-domain test.

In the past, this task has been treated separately in ASR or MT contexts and we propose here a joint estimation of word confidence for a spoken language translation (SLT) task involving both ASR and MT. This research work is possible because we built a specific corpus which is first presented.

The rest of the paper illustrates how such a corpus (made available to the research community) can be used for evaluating word confidence estimators in ASR, MT or SLT scenarios.

C14-1210,Soft Dependency Matching for Hierarchical Phrase-based Machine Translation,"This paper proposes a soft dependency matching model for hierarchical phrase-based (HPB) machine translation. When a HPB rule is extracted, we enrich it with dependency knowledge automatically learnt from the training data. The dependency knowledge not only encodes the dependency relations between the components inside the rule, but also contains the dependency relations between the rule and its context. When a rule is applied to translate a sentence, the dependency knowledge is used to compute the syntactic structural consistency of the rule against the dependency tree of the sentence. We characterize the structure consistency by three features and integrate them into the standard SMT log-linear model to guide the translation process. Our method is evaluated on multiple Chinese-to-English machine translation test sets. The experimental results show that our soft matching model achieves 0.7-1.4 BLEU points improvements over a strong baseline of an in-house implemented HPB translation system.
