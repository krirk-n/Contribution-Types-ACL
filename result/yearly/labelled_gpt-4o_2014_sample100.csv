P14-1143,Smart Selection,"Natural touch interfaces, common now in devices such as tablets and smartphones, make it cumbersome for users to select text. There is a need for a new text selection paradigm that goes beyond the high acuity selection-by-mouse that we have relied on for decades. In this paper, we introduce such a paradigm, called Smart Selection, which aims to recover a user's intended text selection from her touch input. We model the problem using an ensemble learning approach, which leverages multiple linguistic analysis techniques combined with information from a knowledge base and a Web graph. We collect a dataset of true intended user selections and simulated user touches via a large-scale crowdsourcing task, which we release to the academic community. We show that our model effectively addresses the smart selection task and significantly outperforms various baselines and standalone linguistic analysis techniques.",2014,True,True,False,False,False,False,False,"A, B",281,3,284
P14-2003,Probabilistic Labeling for Efficient Referential Grounding based on Collaborative Discourse,"When humans and artificial agents (e.g. robots) have mismatched perceptions of the shared environment, referential communication between them becomes difficult. To mediate perceptual differences, this paper presents a new approach using probabilistic labeling for referential grounding. This approach aims to integrate different types of evidence from the collaborative referential discourse into a unified scheme. Its probabilistic labeling procedure can generate multiple grounding hypotheses to facilitate follow-up dialogue. Our empirical results have shown the probabilistic labeling approach significantly outperforms a previous graphmatching approach for referential grounding.",2014,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"B, D",228,3,231

Frequentist approaches like Support Vector Machines are the state-of-the-art in many tasks. However, these approaches lack efficient procedures for model selection, which hinders the usage of more advanced kernels. In this work, we propose the use of a Bayesian approach for kernel methods, Gaussian Processes, which allow easy model fitting even for complex kernel combinations.

P14-1076,Robust Domain Adaptation for Relation Extraction via Clustering Consistency,"We propose a two-phase framework to adapt existing relation extraction classifiers to extract relations for new target domains. We address two challenges: negative transfer when knowledge in source domains is used without considering the differences in relation distributions; and lack of adequate labeled samples for rarer relations in the new domain, due to a small labeled data set and imbalance relation distributions. Our framework leverages on both labeled and unlabeled data in the target domain. First, we determine the relevance of each source domain to the target domain for each relation type, using the consistency between the clustering given by the target domain labels and the clustering given by the predictors trained for the source domain. To overcome the lack of labeled samples for rarer relations, these clusterings operate on both the labeled and unlabeled data in the target domain. Second, we trade-off between using relevance-weighted sourcedomain predictors and the labeled target data. Again, to overcome the imbalance distribution, the source-domain predictors operate on the unlabeled target data. Our method outperforms numerous baselines and a weakly-supervised relation extraction method on ACE 2004 and YAGO.",2014,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,"D, G",341,3,344

However, manually validating these resources is prohibitively expensive, even when using methods such as crowdsourcing. We propose a cost-effective method of validating and extending knowledge bases using video games with a purpose. Two video games were created to validate conceptconcept and concept-image relations.

LSH accounts for neighbor candidate pruning, while ITQ provides an efficient and effective reranking over the neighbor pool captured by LSH. Furthermore, the proposed hashing framework capitalizes on both term and topic similarity among documents, leading to precise document retrieval. The experimental results convincingly show that our hashing based document retrieval approach well approximates the conventional Information Retrieval (IR) method in terms of retrieving semantically similar documents, and meanwhile achieves a speedup of over one order of magnitude in query time.",2014,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"B, D",281,3,284

P14-1088,A chance-corrected measure of inter-annotator agreement for syntax,"Following the works of Carletta (1996) and Artstein and Poesio (2008) , there is an increasing consensus within the field that in order to properly gauge the reliability of an annotation effort, chance-corrected measures of inter-annotator agreement should be used. With this in mind, it is striking that virtually all evaluations of syntactic annotation efforts use uncorrected parser evaluation metrics such as bracket F 1 (for phrase structure) and accuracy scores (for dependencies). In this work we present a chance-corrected metric based on Krippendorff's α, adapted to the structure of syntactic annotations and applicable both to phrase structure and dependency annotation without any modifications. To evaluate our metric we first present a number of synthetic experiments to better control the sources of noise and gauge the metric's responses, before finally contrasting the behaviour of our chance-corrected metric with that of uncorrected parser evaluation metrics on real corpora. 1",2014,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,"C, E",315,3,318

Previous work established that MEANT reflects translation adequacy with state-of-the-art accuracy, and optimizing MT systems against MEANT robustly improves translation quality. However, to go beyond tuning weights in the loglinear SMT model, a cross-lingual objective function that can deeply integrate semantic frame criteria into the MT training pipeline is needed. We show that cross-lingual XMEANT outperforms monolingual MEANT by (1) replacing the monolingual context vector model in MEANT with simple translation probabilities, and (2) incorporating bracketing ITG constraints.",2014,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,"A, C",283,3,286

P14-1007,Simple Negation Scope Resolution through Deep Parsing: A Semantic Solution to a Semantic Problem,"In this work, we revisit Shared Task 1 from the 2012 *SEM Conference: the automated analysis of negation. Unlike the vast majority of participating systems in 2012, our approach works over explicit and formal representations of propositional semantics, i.e. derives the notion of negation scope assumed in this task from the structure of logical-form meaning representations. We relate the task-specific interpretation of (negation) scope to the concept of (quantifier and operator) scope in mainstream underspecified semantics. With reference to an explicit encoding of semantic predicate-argument structure, we can operationalize the annotation decisions made for the 2012 *SEM task, and demonstrate how a comparatively simple system for negation scope resolution can be built from an off-the-shelf deep parsing system.

We aim to predict a score that quantifies this effort, using linguistic properties of the text. Our proposed metric is called Sentiment Annotation Complexity (SAC). As for training data, since any direct judgment of complexity by a human annotator is fraught with subjectivity, we rely on cognitive evidence from eye-tracking. The sentences in our dataset are labeled with SAC scores derived from eye-fixation duration. Using linguistic features and annotated SACs, we train a regressor that predicts the SAC with a best mean error rate of 22.02% for five-fold cross-validation. We also study the correlation between a human annotator's perception of complexity and a machine's confidence in polarity determination. The merit of our work lies in (a) deciding the sentiment annotation cost in, for example, a crowdsourcing setting, (b) choosing the right classifier for sentiment prediction.",2014,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,"A, E",319,3,322

We explore instead the use of Lagrangian relaxation to decouple the two subproblems and solve them separately. While dynamic programming is viable for bigram-based sentence compression, finding optimal compressed trees within graphs is NP-hard. We recover approximate solutions to this problem using LP relaxation and maximum spanning tree algorithms, yielding techniques that can be combined with the efficient bigrambased inference approach using Lagrange multipliers. Experiments show that these approximation strategies produce results comparable to a state-of-the-art integer linear programming formulation for the same joint inference task along with a significant improvement in runtime.",2014,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,"C, D",264,3,267

To tackle the sparsity and noise challenges, we propose solving the classification problem using matrix completion on factorized matrix of minimized rank. We formulate relation classification as completing the unknown labels of testing items (entity pairs) in a sparse matrix that concatenates training and testing textual features with training labels. Our algorithmic framework is based on the assumption that the rank of item-byfeature and item-by-label joint matrix is low. We apply two optimization models to recover the underlying low-rank matrix leveraging the sparsity of feature-label matrix. The matrix completion problem is then solved by the fixed point continuation (FPC) algorithm, which can find the global optimum. Experiments on two widely used datasets with different dimensions of textual features demonstrate that our low-rank matrix completion approach significantly outperforms the baseline and the state-of-the-art methods.",2014,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,"C, D",308,3,311

The second model simultaneously learns multiple font styles and, as a result, is able to accurately track italic and nonitalic portions of documents. Richer models complicate inference so we present a new, streamlined procedure that is over 25x faster than the method used by Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. (2013) .

After training, the model learns how to embed each phrase semantically in two languages and also learns how to transform semantic embedding space in one language to the other. We evaluate our proposed method on two end-to-end SMT tasks (phrase table pruning and decoding with phrasal semantic similarities) which need to measure semantic similarity between a source phrase and its translation candidates.

To address this issue, we propose two novel models to encourage generating such transitional expressions by introducing the source compoundcomplex sentence structure (CSS). Our models include a CSS-based translation model, which generates new CSS-based translation rules, and a generative transfer model, which encourages producing transitional expressions during decoding.

Our model adopts a greedy bottom-up approach, with two linear-chain CRFs applied in cascade as local classifiers. To enhance the accuracy of the pipeline, we add additional constraints in the Viterbi decoding of the first CRF.

We identify whether a candidate word pair has hypernym-hyponym relation by using the word-embedding-based semantic projections between words and their hypernyms. Our result, an F-score of 73.74%, outperforms the state-of-theart methods on a manually labeled test dataset. Moreover, combining our method with a previous manually-built hierarchy extension method can further improve Fscore to 80.29%.",2014,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"B, D",272,3,275
P14-2022,Faster Phrase-Based Decoding by Refining Feature State,"We contribute a faster decoding algorithm for phrase-based machine translation. Translation hypotheses keep track of state, such as context for the language model and coverage of words in the source sentence. Most features depend upon only part of the state, but traditional algorithms, including cube pruning, handle state atomically. For example, cube pruning will repeatedly query the language model with hypotheses that differ only in source coverage, despite the fact that source coverage is irrelevant to the language model. Our key contribution avoids this behavior by placing hypotheses into equivalence classes, masking the parts of state that matter least to the score. Moreover, we exploit shared words in hypotheses to iteratively refine language model scores rather than handling language model state atomically. Since our algorithm and cube pruning are both approximate, improvement can be used to increase speed or accuracy. When tuned to attain the same accuracy, our algorithm is 4.0-7.7 times as fast as the Moses decoder with cube pruning.",2014,False,True,True,False,False,False,False,"C, B",309,3,312

We show that even when limited or no selfauthored data is available, language from friend, retweet and user mention communications provide sufficient evidence for prediction. When updating models over time based on Twitter, we find that political preference can be often be predicted using roughly 100 tweets, depending on the context of user selection, where this could mean hours, or weeks, based on the author's tweeting frequency.",2014,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"D, E",290,3,293

Such lexicons remain a scarce resource for most languages. In this paper, we address this lexicon gap by building high-quality sentiment lexicons for 136 major languages. We integrate a variety of linguistic resources to produce an immense knowledge graph. By appropriately propagating from seed words, we construct sentiment lexicons for each component language of our graph. Our lexicons have a polarity agreement of 95.7% with published lexicons, while achieving an overall coverage of 45.2%.

The cross-narrative coreference and temporal relation weights used in both these approaches are learned from a corpus of clinical narratives.

Specifically, the method quantifies the degree to which pieces of information in the input change one's beliefs' about the world represented in the background.

Monolingual UWS approaches of explicitly modeling the probabilities of words through Dirichlet process (DP) models or Pitman-Yor process (PYP) models have achieved high accuracy, but their bilingual counterparts have only been carried out on small corpora such as basic travel expression corpus (BTEC) due to the computational complexity. This paper proposes an efficient unified PYP-based monolingual and bilingual UWS method.

For example, international relations can be strained by how the media in one country describes an event in another; and papers can be rejected because they overstate or understate their findings. It is thus important to understand the effects of statement strength. A first step is to be able to distinguish between strong and weak statements. However, even this problem is understudied, partly due to a lack of data. Since strength is inherently relative, revisions of texts that make claims are a natural source of data on strength differences. In this paper, we introduce a corpus of sentence-level revisions from academic writing.

P14-1043,Ambiguity-aware Ensemble Training for Semi-supervised Dependency Parsing,"This paper proposes a simple yet effective framework for semi-supervised dependency parsing at entire tree level, referred to as ambiguity-aware ensemble training. Instead of only using 1best parse trees in previous work, our core idea is to utilize parse forest (ambiguous labelings) to combine multiple 1-best parse trees generated from diverse parsers on unlabeled data. With a conditional random field based probabilistic dependency parser, our training objective is to maximize mixed likelihood of labeled data and auto-parsed unlabeled data with ambiguous labelings. This framework offers two promising advantages. 1) ambiguity encoded in parse forests compromises noise in 1-best parse trees. During training, the parser is aware of these ambiguous structures, and has the flexibility to distribute probability mass to its preferred parse trees as long as the likelihood improves. 2) diverse syntactic structures produced by different parsers can be naturally compiled into forest, offering complementary strength to our single-view parser. Experimental results on benchmark data show that our method significantly outperforms the baseline supervised parser and other entire-tree based semi-supervised methods, such as self-training, co-training and tri-training.",2014,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"B, D",346,3,349

Previous works often use syntax constituents in this task. However, syntax-based methods can only use discrete contextual information, which may suffer from data sparsity. This paper proposes a novel product feature mining method which leverages lexical and contextual semantic clues. Lexical semantic clue verifies whether a candidate term is related to the target product, and contextual semantic clue serves as a soft pattern miner to find candidates, which exploits semantics of each word in context so as to alleviate the data sparsity problem. We build a semantic similarity graph to encode lexical semantic clue, and employ a convolutional neural model to capture contextual semantic clue. Then Label Propagation is applied to combine both semantic clues. Experimental results show that our semantics-based method significantly outperforms conventional syntaxbased approaches, which not only mines product features more accurately, but also extracts more infrequent product features.",2014,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"B, D",301,3,304

We investigate a largely unsupervised approach to learning interpretable, domain-specific entity types from unlabeled text. It assumes that any common noun in a domain can function as potential entity type, and uses those nouns as hidden variables in a HMM. To constrain training, it extracts co-occurrence dictionaries of entities and common nouns from the data. We evaluate the learned types by measuring their prediction accuracy for verb arguments in several domains. The results suggest that it is possible to learn domain-specific entity types from unlabeled data.

For current MT quality estimation (QE) systems, additional complexity comes from the difficulty to model user and domain changes. Indeed, the instability of the systems with respect to data coming from different distributions calls for adaptive solutions that react to new operating conditions. To tackle this issue we propose an online framework for adaptive QE that targets reactivity and robustness to user and domain changes.
