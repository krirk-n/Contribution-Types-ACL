P13-1119,Crowdsourcing Interaction Logs to Understand Text Reuse from the Web,"We report on the construction of the Webis text reuse corpus 2012 for advanced research on text reuse. The corpus compiles manually written documents obtained from a completely controlled, yet representative environment that emulates the web. Each of the 297 documents in the corpus is about one of the 150 topics used at the TREC Web Tracks 2009-2011, thus forming a strong connection with existing evaluation efforts. Writers, hired at the crowdsourcing platform oDesk, had to retrieve sources for a given topic and to reuse text from what they found. Part of the corpus are detailed interaction logs that consistently cover the search for sources as well as the creation of documents. This will allow for in-depth analyses of how text is composed if a writer is at liberty to reuse texts from a third party-a setting which has not been studied so far. In addition, the corpus provides an original resource for the evaluation of text reuse and plagiarism detectors, where currently only less realistic resources are employed.",2013,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,"A, E",317,3,320

Furthermore, data mismatch issues, which arise when the expected test (target) data does not exactly match the training data, aggravate this scarcity problem. To deal with these issues, we describe an efficient semisupervised learning (SSL) approach which has two components: (i) Markov Topic Regression is a new probabilistic model to cluster words into semantic tags (concepts). It can efficiently handle semantic ambiguity by extending standard topic models with two new features. First, it encodes word n-gram features from labeled source and unlabeled target data. Second, by going beyond a bag-of-words approach, it takes into account the inherent sequential nature of utterances to learn semantic classes based on context. (ii) Retrospective Learner is a new learning technique that adapts to the unlabeled target data.

Through the smoothing, all the optimal senses are obtained at one time under maximum marginal likelihood criterion, by competitive probabilistic kernels made to reinforce one another among nearby words, and to suppress conflicting sense hypotheses within the same word.

As a result, the algorithm avoids issues observed when pruning Kneser-Ney models (Siivola et al., 2007; Chelba et al., 2010) , while retaining the benefits of such marginal distribution constraints.

Moreover, we propose a further improved model that considers richer context by discriminating label sequences that specify spans from the CP to NP candidates. It enables our model to learn the effect of relative word order among NP candidates as well as to learn the effect of distances from the training data.

However, as is well known, HBMs are ""ideal"" learning systems, assuming access to unlimited computational resources that may not be available to child language learners. Consequently, it remains crucial to carefully assess the use of HBMs along with alternative, possibly simpler, candidate models. This paper presents such an evaluation for a language acquisition domain where explicit HBMs have been proposed: the acquisition of English dative constructions. In particular, we present a detailed, empiricallygrounded model-selection comparison of HBMs vs. a simpler alternative based on clustering along with maximum likelihood estimation that we call linear competition learning (LCL).

Instead, we introduce a Compositional Vector Grammar (CVG), which combines PCFGs with a syntactically untied recursive neural network that learns syntactico-semantic, compositional vector representations. The CVG improves the PCFG of the Stanford Parser by 3.8% to obtain an F1 score of 90.4%.

In this paper, the problem of data sparsity in sentiment analysis, both monolingual and cross-lingual, is addressed through the means of clustering. Experiments show that cluster based data sparsity reduction leads to performance better than sense based classification for sentiment analysis at document level.

Our method would eventually find the global maximum (up to a user-specified ) if run for long enough, but at any point can return a suboptimal solution together with an upper bound on the global maximum. As an illustrative case, we study a generative model for dependency parsing. We search for the maximum-likelihood model parameters and corpus parse, subject to posterior constraints. We show how to formulate this as a mixed integer quadratic programming problem with nonlinear constraints.

As an alternative approach for social media, we can assume that users who share the same opinions will link to each other.

Thus, we obtain a decoding feature whose value represents the phrase pair's closeness to the dev. This is a simple, computationally cheap form of instance weighting for phrase pairs. Experiments on large scale NIST evaluation data show improvements over strong baselines: +1.8 BLEU on Arabic to English and +1.4 BLEU on Chinese to English over a non-adapted baseline, and significant improvements in most circumstances over baselines with linear mixture model adaptation.

In this paper we present a comprehensive treatment of ECs by first recovering them with a structured MaxEnt model with a rich set of syntactic and lexical features, and then incorporating the predicted ECs into a Chinese-to-English machine translation task through multiple approaches, including the extraction of EC-specific sparse features. We show that the recovered empty categories not only improve the word alignment quality, but also lead to significant improvements in a large-scale state-of-the-art syntactic MT system.",2013,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,"D, G",273,3,276
P13-1062,Bootstrapping Entity Translation on Weakly Comparable Corpora,"This paper studies the problem of mining named entity translations from comparable corpora with some ""asymmetry"". Unlike the previous approaches relying on the ""symmetry"" found in parallel corpora, the proposed method is tolerant to asymmetry often found in comparable corpora, by distinguishing different semantics of relations of entity pairs to selectively propagate seed entity translations on weakly comparable corpora. Our experimental results on English-Chinese corpora show that our selective propagation approach outperforms the previous approaches in named entity translation in terms of the mean reciprocal rank by up to 0.16 for organization names, and 0.14 in a low comparability case.",2013,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,"D, G",248,3,251

In contrast to previous work, we first narrow down the gap between Egyptian and MSA by applying an automatic characterlevel transformational model that changes Egyptian to EG , which looks similar to MSA. The transformations include morphological, phonological and spelling changes. The transformation reduces the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from 5.2% to 2.6% and gives a gain of 1.87 BLEU points. Further, adapting large MSA/English parallel data increases the lexical coverage, reduces OOVs to 0.7% and leads to an absolute BLEU improvement of 2.73 points.",2013,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,"D, G",273,3,276
P13-1089,Margin-based Decomposed Amortized Inference,"Given that structured output prediction is typically performed over entire datasets, one natural question is whether it is possible to re-use computation from earlier inference instances to speed up inference for future instances. Amortized inference has been proposed as a way to accomplish this. In this paper, first, we introduce a new amortized inference algorithm called the Margin-based Amortized Inference, which uses the notion of structured margin to identify inference problems for which previous solutions are provably optimal. Second, we introduce decomposed amortized inference, which is designed to address very large inference problems, where earlier amortization methods become less effective. This approach works by decomposing the output structure and applying amortization piece-wise, thus increasing the chance that we can re-use previous solutions for parts of the output structure. These parts are then combined to a global coherent solution using Lagrangian relaxation. In our experiments, using the NLP tasks of semantic role labeling and entityrelation extraction, we demonstrate that with the margin-based algorithm, we need to call the inference engine only for a third of the test examples. Further, we show that the decomposed variant of margin-based amortized inference achieves a greater reduction in the number of inference calls.",2013,False,False,True,True,False,False,False,"C, D",359,3,362
P13-1148,A joint model of word segmentation and phonological variation for {E}nglish word-final /t/-deletion,"Word-final /t/-deletion refers to a common phenomenon in spoken English where words such as /wEst/ ""west"" are pronounced as [wEs] ""wes"" in certain contexts. Phonological variation like this is common in naturally occurring speech. Current computational models of unsupervised word segmentation usually assume idealized input that is devoid of these kinds of variation. We extend a non-parametric model of word segmentation by adding phonological rules that map from underlying forms to surface forms to produce a mathematically well-defined joint model as a first step towards handling variation and segmentation in a single model. We analyse how our model handles /t/-deletion on a large corpus of transcribed speech, and show that the joint model can perform word segmentation and recover underlying /t/s. We find that Bigram dependencies are important for performing well on real data and for learning appropriate deletion probabilities for different contexts. 1 1 The implementation of our model as well as scripts to prepare the data will be made available at http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~bborschi. We can't release our version of the Buckeye Corpus (Pitt et al., 2007) directly because of licensing issues. an extension of the Bayesian models of Goldwater et al. (2009)  that incorporates phonological rules to ""explain away"" surface variation. As a concrete example, we focus on word-final /t/deletion in English, although our approach is not limited to this case. We choose /t/-deletion because it is a very common and well-studied phenomenon (see Coetzee (2004, Chapter 5) for a review) and segmental deletion is an interesting test-case for our architecture. Recent work has found that /t/-deletion (among other things) is indeed common in child-directed speech (CDS) and, importantly, that its distribution is similar to that in adult-directed speech (ADS) (Dilley et al., to appear). This justifies our using ADS to evaluate our model, as discussed below.",2013,False,True,False,False,False,True,False,"B, F",539,3,542

P13-1033,A {M}arkov Model of Machine Translation using Non-parametric {B}ayesian Inference,"Most modern machine translation systems use phrase pairs as translation units, allowing for accurate modelling of phraseinternal translation and reordering. However phrase-based approaches are much less able to model sentence level effects between different phrase-pairs. We propose a new model to address this imbalance, based on a word-based Markov model of translation which generates target translations left-to-right. Our model encodes word and phrase level phenomena by conditioning translation decisions on previous decisions and uses a hierarchical Pitman-Yor Process prior to provide dynamic adaptive smoothing. This mechanism implicitly supports not only traditional phrase pairs, but also gapping phrases which are non-consecutive in the source.

Adopting a classical Bayesian perspective, we performs posterior inference over hundreds of languages, leveraging knowledge of known languages and alphabets to uncover general linguistic patterns of typologically coherent language clusters. We achieve average accuracy in the unsupervised consonant/vowel prediction task of 99% across 503 languages. We further show that our methodology can be used to predict more fine-grained phonetic distinctions. On a three-way classification task between vowels, nasals, and nonnasal consonants, our model yields unsupervised accuracy of 89% across the same set of languages.",2013,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,"A, D",266,3,269

We investigate the rÃ´le that these co-ordinating temporal signals have in determining the type of temporal relations in discourse. Using machine learning, we improve upon prior approaches to the problem, achieving over 80% accuracy at labelling the types of temporal relation between events and times that are related by temporal signals.",2013,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"D, E",235,3,238

Part-of-speech tagging is a crucial preliminary process in many natural language processing applications. Because many words in natural languages have more than one part-of-speech tag, resolving part-of-speech ambiguity is an important task. We claim that partof-speech ambiguity can be solved using substitute vectors. A substitute vector is constructed with possible substitutes of a target word. This study is built on previous work which has proven that word substitutes are very fruitful for part-ofspeech induction. Experiments show that our methodology works for words with high ambiguity.",2013,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"D, E",245,3,248

Moreover, investigating these deviations provides new insights and a deeper understanding of the examined techniques.

Similarly to multi-view learning, the ""segmentation agreements"" between the two different types of view are used to overcome the scarcity of the label information on unlabeled data. The proposed approach trains a character-based and word-based model on labeled data, respectively, as the initial models. Then, the two models are constantly updated using unlabeled examples, where the learning objective is maximizing their segmentation agreements. The agreements are regarded as a set of valuable constraints for regularizing the learning of both models on unlabeled data. The segmentation for an input sentence is decoded by using a joint scoring function combining the two induced models.
