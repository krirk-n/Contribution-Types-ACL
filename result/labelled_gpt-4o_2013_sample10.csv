U13-1021,e-Learning with {K}aggle in Class: Adapting the {ALTA} Shared Task 2013 to a Class Project,"The 2013 ALTA Shared Task was utilised as a class project for a subject taught at The University of Melbourne in the second semester of 2013. This paper reviews the experience of using an on-line, Kaggle in Class-based shared task for class work. Adoption of the shared task enables a blended learning paradigm that engages students in problem-based learning in a shared and open context.",2013,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,"G, D",196,3,199
R13-2017,{K}orean Word-Sense Disambiguation Using Parallel Corpus as Additional Resource,"Most previous research on Korean Word-Sense Disambiguation (WSD) were focusing on unsupervised corpus-based or knowledge-based approach because they suffered from lack of sense-tagged Korean corpora.Recently, along with great effort of constructing sense-tagged Korean corpus by government and researchers, finding appropriate features for supervised learning approach and improving its prediction accuracy became an issue. To achieve higher word-sense prediction accuracy, this paper aimed to find most appropriate features for Korean WSD based on Conditional Random Field (CRF) approach. Also, we utilized Korean-Japanese parallel corpus to enlarge size of sensetagged corpus, and improved prediction accuracy with it. Experimental result reveals that our method can achieve 95.67% of prediction accuracy.",2013,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,"D, G",267,3,270
P13-1055,Identifying Bad Semantic Neighbors for Improving Distributional Thesauri,"Distributional thesauri are now widely used in a large number of Natural Language Processing tasks. However, they are far from containing only interesting semantic relations. As a consequence, improving such thesaurus is an important issue that is mainly tackled indirectly through the improvement of semantic similarity measures. In this article, we propose a more direct approach focusing on the identification of the neighbors of a thesaurus entry that are not semantically linked to this entry. This identification relies on a discriminative classifier trained from unsupervised selected examples for building a distributional model of the entry in texts. Its bad neighbors are found by applying this classifier to a representative set of occurrences of each of these neighbors. We evaluate the interest of this method for a large set of English nouns with various frequencies.",2013,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"D, E",271,3,274
P13-2075,Minimum {B}ayes Risk based Answer Re-ranking for Question Answering,"This paper presents two minimum Bayes risk (MBR) based Answer Re-ranking (MBRAR) approaches for the question answering (QA) task. The first approach re-ranks single QA system's outputs by using a traditional MBR model, by measuring correlations between answer candidates; while the second approach reranks the combined outputs of multiple QA systems with heterogenous answer extraction components by using a mixture model-based MBR model. Evaluations are performed on factoid questions selected from two different domains: Jeopardy! and Web, and significant improvements are achieved on all data sets.",2013,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,"D, G",234,3,237
S13-2001,"{S}em{E}val-2013 Task 1: {T}emp{E}val-3: Evaluating Time Expressions, Events, and Temporal Relations","Within the SemEval-2013 evaluation exercise, the TempEval-3 shared task aims to advance research on temporal information processing. It follows on from TempEval-1 and -2, with: a three-part structure covering temporal expression, event, and temporal relation extraction; a larger dataset; and new single measures to rank systems -in each task and in general. In this paper, we describe the participants' approaches, results, and the observations from the results, which may guide future research in this area.",2013,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,"A, E",221,3,224
S13-2002,{C}lear{TK}-{T}ime{ML}: A minimalist approach to {T}emp{E}val 2013,"The ClearTK-TimeML submission to Temp-Eval 2013 competed in all English tasks: identifying events, identifying times, and identifying temporal relations. The system is a pipeline of machine-learning models, each with a small set of features from a simple morpho-syntactic annotation pipeline, and where temporal relations are only predicted for a small set of syntactic constructions and relation types. ClearTK-TimeML ranked 1 st for temporal relation F1, time extent strict F1 and event tense accuracy.",2013,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,"D, G",219,3,222
W13-2713,The (Un)faithful Machine Translator,"Applying machine translation (MT) to literary texts involves the same domain shift challenges that arise for any sublanguage (e.g. medical or scientific). However, it also introduces additional challenges. One focus in the discussion of translation theory in the humanities has been on the human translator's role in staying faithful to an original text versus adapting it to make it more familiar to readers. In contrast to other domains, one objective in literary translation is to preserve the experience of reading a text when moving to the target language. We use existing MT systems to translate samples of French literature into English. We then use qualitative analysis grounded in translation theory and real example outputs in order to address what makes literary translation particularly hard and the potential role of the machine in it.",2013,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,"E, G",266,3,269
W13-2903,The {C}-Score {--} Proposing a Reading Comprehension Metrics as a Common Evaluation Measure for Text Simplification,"This article addresses the lack of common approaches for text simplification evaluation, by presenting the first attempt for a common evaluation metrics. The article proposes reading comprehension evaluation as a method for evaluating the results of Text Simplification (TS). An experiment, as an example application of the evaluation method, as well as three formulae to quantify reading comprehension, are presented. The formulae produce an unique score, the C-score, which gives an estimation of user's reading comprehension of a certain text. The score can be used to evaluate the performance of a text simplification engine on pairs of complex and simplified texts, or to compare the performances of different TS methods using the same texts. The approach can be particularly useful for the modern crowdsourcing approaches, such as those employing the Amazon's Mechanical Turk 1 or CrowdFlower 2 . The aim of this paper is thus to propose an evaluation approach and to motivate the TS community to start a relevant discussion, in order to come up with a common evaluation metrics for this task.",2013,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,"A, D",319,3,322
P13-2148,Identifying Sentiment Words Using an Optimization-based Model without Seed Words,"Sentiment Word Identification (SWI) is a basic technique in many sentiment analysis applications. Most existing researches exploit seed words, and lead to low robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-based model for SWI. Unlike previous approaches, our model exploits the sentiment labels of documents instead of seed words. Several experiments on real datasets show that WEED is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with seed words.",2013,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,"B, D",206,3,209
P13-2078,Measuring semantic content in distributional vectors,"Some words are more contentful than others: for instance, make is intuitively more general than produce and fifteen is more 'precise' than a group. In this paper, we propose to measure the 'semantic content' of lexical items, as modelled by distributional representations. We investigate the hypothesis that semantic content can be computed using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, an informationtheoretic measure of the relative entropy of two distributions. In a task focusing on retrieving the correct ordering of hyponym-hypernym pairs, the KL divergence achieves close to 80% precision but does not outperform a simpler (linguistically unmotivated) frequency measure. We suggest that this result illustrates the rather 'intensional' aspect of distributions.",2013,False,False,True,False,True,False,False,"C, E",273,3,276
