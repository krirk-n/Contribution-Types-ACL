W12-1603,"{``}Love ya, jerkface{''}: Using Sparse Log-Linear Models to Build Positive and Impolite Relationships with Teens","One challenge of implementing spoken dialogue systems for long-term interaction is how to adapt the dialogue as user and system become more familiar. We believe this challenge includes evoking and signaling aspects of long-term relationships such as rapport. For tutoring systems, this may additionally require knowing how relationships are signaled among non-adult users. We therefore investigate conversational strategies used by teenagers in peer tutoring dialogues, and how these strategies function differently among friends or strangers. In particular, we use annotated and automatically extracted linguistic devices to predict impoliteness and positivity in the next turn. To take into account the sparse nature of these features in real data we use models including Lasso, ridge estimator, and elastic net. We evaluate the predictive power of our models under various settings, and compare our sparse models with standard non-sparse solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that our models are more accurate than non-sparse models quantitatively, and that teens use unexpected kinds of language to do relationship work such as signaling rapport, but friends and strangers, tutors and tutees, carry out this work in quite different ways from one another.",2012,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,"E, F",337,3,340
W12-4807,{L}uit{P}ad: A fully {U}nicode compatible {A}ssamese writing software,"LuitPad is a stand-alone, fully Unicode compliant software designed for rapid typing of Assamese words and characters. There are two main typing options; one which is based on approximate sound of words and the other based on the sound of characters, both of which are efficient and user-friendly, even for a first-time user. In addition, LuitPad comes with an online spell-checker; on ""right-clock"" over a misspelt word, presents the user with a list of relevant appropriate corrections for replacements. Assamese is an Indic language, spoken throughout North-Eastern parts of India by approximately 30 million people. There is a severe lack of user-friendly software available for typing Assamese text. This is perhaps the underlying reason for the miniscule presence of Assamese based information storage and retrieval systems, both off-line and on-line. With LuitPad, the user can retrieve Assamese characters and words using an English alphabet based keyboard in an effective and intuitive way. LuitPad is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux with a GUI. The software can store the contents in LuitPad file format ("".pad"" extension) that can store images and text. In addition, .pad files can be easily exported to pdf and html files.",2012,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,"G, A",367,3,370
W12-5116,{SEJFEK} - a Lexicon and a Shallow Grammar of {P}olish Economic Multi-Word Units,"We present a large-coverage lexical and grammatical resource of Polish economic terminology. It consists of two alternative modules. One is a grammatical lexicon of about 11,000 terminological multi-word units, where inflectional and syntactic variation, as well as nesting of terms, are described via graph-based rules. The other one is a fully lexicalized shallow grammar, obtained by an automatic conversion of the lexicon, and partly manually validated. Both resources have a good coverage, evaluated on a manually annotated corpus, and are freely available under the Creative Commons BY-SA license.",2012,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,"A, E",233,3,236
W12-2006,{HOO} 2012: A Report on the Preposition and Determiner Error Correction Shared Task,"Incorrect usage of prepositions and determiners constitute the most common types of errors made by non-native speakers of English. It is not surprising, then, that there has been a significant amount of work directed towards the automated detection and correction of such errors. However, to date, the use of different data sets and different task definitions has made it difficult to compare work on the topic. This paper reports on the HOO 2012 shared task on error detection and correction in the use of prepositions and determiners, where systems developed by 14 teams from around the world were evaluated on the same previously unseen errorful text.",2012,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,"A, G",243,3,246

Wikipedia has been a very important corpus and knowledge bank. Although Wikipedia describes itself not a dictionary or encyclopedia, it is if high potential values in applications and data mining researches. Link discovery is a useful IR application, based on Data Mining and NLP algorithms and has been used in several fields.

P12-2068,Sentence Compression with Semantic Role Constraints,"For sentence compression, we propose new semantic constraints to directly capture the relations between a predicate and its arguments, whereas the existing approaches have focused on relatively shallow linguistic properties, such as lexical and syntactic information. These constraints are based on semantic roles and superior to the constraints of syntactic dependencies. Our empirical evaluation on the Written News Compression Corpus (Clarke and Lapata, 2008) demonstrates that our system achieves results comparable to other state-of-the-art techniques.",2012,False,False,False,True,True,False,False,"D, E",211,3,214
E12-2003,Collaborative Machine Translation Service for Scientific texts,"French researchers are required to frequently translate into French the description of their work published in English. At the same time, the need for French people to access articles in English, or to international researchers to access theses or papers in French, is incorrectly resolved via the use of generic translation tools. We propose the demonstration of an end-to-end tool integrated in the HAL open archive for enabling efficient translation for scientific texts. This tool can give translation suggestions adapted to the scientific domain, improving by more than 10 points the BLEU score of a generic system. It also provides a post-edition service which captures user post-editing data that can be used to incrementally improve the translations engines. Thus it is helpful for users which need to translate or to access scientific texts.",2012,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,"D, G",270,3,273
C12-2134,Identifying Temporal Relations by Sentence and Document Optimizations,"This paper presents a temporal relation identification method optimizing relations at sentence and document levels. Temporal relation identification is to identify temporal orders between events and time expressions. Various approaches of this task have been studied through the shared tasks TempEval (Verhagen et al., 2007 (Verhagen et al., , 2010)) . Not only identifying each temporal relation independently, some works also try to find multiple temporal relations jointly by logical constraints in Integer Linear Programming (Chambers",2012,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,"D, G",215,3,218
C12-2138,Cross-Lingual Identification of Ambiguous Discourse Connectives for Resource-Poor Language,"The lack of annotated corpora brings limitations in research of discourse classification for many languages. In this paper, we present the first effort towards recognizing ambiguities of discourse connectives, which is fundamental to discourse classification for resource-poor language such as Chinese. A language independent framework is proposed utilizing bilingual dictionaries, Penn Discourse Treebank and parallel data between English and Chinese. We start from translating the English connectives to Chinese using a bi-lingual dictionary. Then, the ambiguities in terms of senses a connective may signal are estimated based on the ambiguities of English connectives and word alignment information. Finally, the ambiguity between discourse usage and non-discourse usage were disambiguated using the co-training algorithm. Experimental results showed the proposed method not only built a high quality connective lexicon for Chinese but also achieved a high performance in recognizing the ambiguities. We also present a discourse corpus for Chinese which will soon become the first Chinese discourse corpus publicly available.",2012,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,"A, D",309,3,312
2012.eamt-1.63,Adjunct Alignment in Translation Data with an Application to Phrase Based Statistical Machine Translation,"Enriching statistical models with linguistic knowledge has been a major concern in Machine Translation (MT). In monolingual data, adjuncts are optional constituents contributing secondarily to the meaning of a sentence. One can therefore hypothesize that this secondary status is preserved in translation, and thus that adjuncts may align consistently with their adjunct translations, suggesting they form optional phrase pairs in parallel corpora. In this paper we verify this hypothesis on French-English translation data, and explore the utility of compiling adjunct-poor data for augmenting the training data of a phrase-based machine translation model.",2012,False,False,False,False,True,False,True,"E, G",233,3,236
